        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Learning to program has changed my life by the simple fact of being able to do what I like the most: create and build things. I have always felt a great affinity for technology and computers. I could spend hours making things work, researching how to make them work and, of course, learning.</p>

            <h3>Fashion Design & Administration</h3>
            <p>Fashion is also an extremely important part of me, how we dress is a way of expressing ourselves. In my experience as a designer, I have found a world in which I can translate my ideas into a product and connect with my customers through them. As a curious soul and enthusiast of entrepreneurship it is a necessity for me to know more about the fashion business. </p>

        <h3>Social Engagement</h3>
        <p>This is one of the projects I am most proud to be a part of. Aliadas f√ºr Teilhabe und Integracion is a non-profit association that supports Spanish-speaking women to integrate in Germany. As a founding member I am happy to help so many women and support them in this process through my contribution as a graphic designer.</p>
